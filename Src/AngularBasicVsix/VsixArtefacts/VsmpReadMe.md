A basic [Angular.io](https://angular.io/) / [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) web application project template for [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), using [AspNet Core](https://www.asp.net/) (C#), [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (optional).

>##### Based on the [Angular Basic](https://github.com/MattJeanes/AngularBasic) project from [Matt Jeanes](https://mattjeanes.com/).

The project is scaffolded out using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) from within [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

...when you click 'OK' a command prompt is opened to scaffold the new project using Yeoman...
 
 - Node will install the angular-basic Yeoman generator via command `npm install -g yo angular-basic`
 - Yeoman will prompt you for personalisation and custom options for the new project (red border) via command `yo angular-basic`
 - Within seconds Yeoman will create the new project on your hard drive (purple border)
 - Yeoman will automatically download any necessary dependancies (e.g. into `node_modules` folder)

...the new project will be opened in a new instance of Visual Studio, and here's what you get...

...and upon build/run ('F5' in Visual Studio) this is the resultant website application...

> Note: A Visual Studio solution file (`.Sln`) is not created when the project is scaffolded. However when you close Visual Studio you will be prompted to create and save a solution file.
